# How was this made?
Dutchie exposes a bunch of information about menus in a public GraphQL database. This for some reason includes real time stock levels! This is a very basic demo, but one could track all kinds of fun stuff about their competition using this information. Looking to open a dispo near a shop that uses Dutchie? Now you can get real time sales data from the other guys and know if that area is worth your time. Thanks Dutchie!

# How do I stop people from getting at my sales data?
Stop using Dutchie. In the US [Jane](https://www.iheartjane.com/) seems popular. In Canada [Buddi](https://buddi.io/) seems to have been built by people who actually thought about privacy and security. Note, I have no relationship with either of those companies!
